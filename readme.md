# Java Advent of Code 2022 :)

## About

I created this repo so that you can build on your Advent of Code solutions throughout the holiday season.

## Deps

-   java version 21.0.1
-   maven

## Executables

To run the program

-   java -cp target/advent22.jar com.advent22.main.App

Compile methods

-   rvm compile -- will NOT update the JAR
-   rvm package -- will update the JAR

# TODO

-   Create the executable into a single word. Ideally something like advent22\<year\> \<day\> \<problem\>
-   Eliminate the two switch cases in main, turn into some sort of executable based on file name & input params.
-   For show purposes, create a while loop that takes another input instead of exiting the program. Create a condition that allows you to do a one time execution for iterating / debugging.
