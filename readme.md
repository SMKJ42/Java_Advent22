# Java Advent of Code 2022 :)

## about

I created this repo so that you can build on your Advent of Code solutions throughout the holiday season.

## deps

-   java version 21.0.1
-   maven

## executables

To run the program

-   java -cp target/advent22-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.advent22.main.App

Compile methods

-   rvm compile -- will NOT update the JAR
-   rvm package -- will update the JAR

# TODO

-   Create the executable into a single word. Ideally something like advent\<year\> \<day\> \<problem\>
-   eliminate the two switch cases in main, turn into some sort of executable based on file name & input params.
